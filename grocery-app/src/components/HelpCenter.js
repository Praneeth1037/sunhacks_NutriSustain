      category: 'gettingStarted',
      question: 'How do I get started with NutriSustain?',
      answer: 'Getting started is easy! First, add your grocery items manually or use the camera to scan them. The app will automatically track expiry dates and send you notifications. You can then explore recipe suggestions and track your health metrics.'

      id: 3,
      category: 'groceryManagement',
      question: 'How do I add grocery items?',
      answer: 'You can add items in two ways: 1) Manually enter the product name, expiry date (MM/DD/YYYY), quantity, and category, then click "Upload". 2) Use the camera button to take a photo of your grocery item and enter the expiry date when prompted.'
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      category: 'groceryManagement',
      question: 'How does the expiry date tracking work?',
      answer: 'The app automatically calculates days until expiry and color-codes items: Red (urgent - expiring soon), Orange (warning - expiring within a week), Green (normal - plenty of time left). You\'ll get notifications for items expiring within 3 days.'
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      category: 'groceryManagement',
      question: 'Can I move items between Active, Consumed, and Expired categories?',
      answer: 'Yes! Click the green checkmark to mark items as consumed, use the yellow reverse button to move consumed items back to active, and click the red delete button to permanently remove items. You can also drag and drop items between categories.'
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      category: 'groceryManagement',
      question: 'What happens when I mark an item as consumed?',

    },
    {
      id: 7,
      category: 'recipes',
      question: 'How do AI recipe suggestions work?',
      answer: 'The AI analyzes your available ingredients and suggests recipes you can make. You can search for specific dishes, or the system will automatically suggest recipes for items approaching expiry to help reduce waste.'
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      category: 'recipes',
      question: 'Can I save favorite recipes?',

    {
      id: 9,
      category: 'recipes',
      question: 'What if I don\'t have all the ingredients for a recipe?',
      answer: 'The AI only suggests recipes that use ingredients you have in your inventory. If a recipe requires ingredients you don\'t have, it won\'t be suggested. You can always add missing ingredients to your grocery list.'
    },
    {
      id: 10,
      category: 'health',
      question: 'How do I upload my health data?',
